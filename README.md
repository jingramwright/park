## System Overview:

This system's primary function to be used within a garage in order to avoid unwanted collisions when parking the vehicle, however it can also be used to monitor the current position of the garage door, and the presence of the vehicle for security purposes.
  
To achieve this the system will contain components in order to determine the distance from the vehicle to the desired position, the current position of the garage door, and a visual representation of the progress towards the desired position. 

The system will be able to connect to the users preferred WiFi network (provided that it is in range) in order to configure and monitor the system, and in the scenario where this is not a possibility it shall be able to be connected to directly from any device with WiFi capablity in order to provide the same functionality.
